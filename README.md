# PokeTools

PokeTools is a "Swiss army knife" app related to Pokemon. It currently consists of a random Fakemon (fake Pokemon) idea generator. Other planned tools include a type calculator (including Tera Types from Scarlet and Violet), as well as a mobile-friendly Pokedex.

## Make Up a Mon

Make Up a Mon is an artistic tool that generates random ideas for Fakemon. A new idea will be generated every day, although you can also generate new ideas on command.

I **heavily** encourage using this for creative purposes -- please draw the prompt you're given and [share it with me](https://twitter.com/dyl_byl)!

The refresh button at the bottom will generate new ideas on the fly. The share button will create a the Make Up a Mon prompt you used. Share any and all art you've made!
